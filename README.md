# learn-basic-html
I have summarised basic html element tags and attributes for easy and fast learning. 
Contains sample code for practical example.
There is also a CSS file which contain style code used in styling the HTML document. 
Copy HTML and CSS code into your text editor (VSCode) and view website on your browser locally.

HOW TO SET UP TEXT EDITOR!!!

To set up text editor (VSCode or any other code text editor):
1. Download to your PC and install.
2. Next create html file by ending file name with .html (e.g basic.html)
Copy and paste HTML code there.
3. Then create CSS file by ending file name with .css (e.g styledoc.css)
Copy and paste CSS code there.
4. Link CSS file to the HTML file by adding a link tag in the HTML code. 
   Remember, link has no closing tag.

HOW TO RUN CODE LOCALLY!!!

To run code, right click on the html file tab and click on "Open in Default Browser" or "Open in Other Browser" 
This would run code locally (without internet) on your browser.

FINAL TIP!!!

Don't bother about memorizing tags or knowing which tag doesn't allow a closing tag. 
VSCode has an auto complete which when selected completes the code even with a closing tag, if the tag needs one.
